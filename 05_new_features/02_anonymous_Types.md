We have looked at creating objects to creating our own custom classes, to use as sort of a blue print. 

Another way to create objects, using anonymous types. Meaning they don't have a defined type or class. i.e. :

var someObject = new {name = "Mark", age = 26}

a new object created without making a class with these properties. 

might be good to use for light-purposes, i.e. exists for a short time.
